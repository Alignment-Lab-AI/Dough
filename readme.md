# Welcome to Banodoco v. 0.5

Banodoco v. 0.5 is intended to act as a demo of one approach to building a creative tool on top of open-source AI models - empowering users to create videos via creative interpolation using [Steerable Motion](https://github.com/banodoco/steerable-motion) to fill in the gaps between generated keyframes:

## Access the web app or contribute to the project

The web app is currently in beta. If you want access it, please reach out to POM in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/8Wx9dFu5tP) with some examples of stuff you've made before. If you'd like to contribute, please also get in touch with examples of previous projects.

## Coming soon - local inference

We're working on a local inference version of Banodoco, which will be available soon. This will allow you to run the app locally on your own machine, without needing to pay for cloud compute.
