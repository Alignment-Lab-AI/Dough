# Welcome to Banodoco!

Banodoco is a simple but powerful open source animation tool build on top of Stable Diffusion, Google FILM, and various other online machine models.

## 1) Test It Out

You can test out a preview version of Banodoco <a href="https://peter942-banodoco-2-app-le21w4.streamlit.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.

While the buttons and queries won't work and some things won't display properly, it should give you a good idea of what to expect. 

## 2) Download The Repo

If you're comfortable with Git, you can pull this repo as normal. If you're not and don't want to figure that out, you can click "Code" in the top right, then click Download Zip to download all the files. 

## 3) Open Terminal

Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where you downloaded the repo.

To do this quick, you can type `cd` and then drag the folder into the terminal and press enter.

## 4) Install Dependencies

To install the dependencies, you can run the following command in your open terminal window:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you're a developer, you'll probably want to install these in a virtual environment.

## 5) Run The App

To run the app, you can run the following command in your terminal window:

`streamlit run app.py`

This should open a new tab in your browser with the app running. If it doesn't, you can copy and paste the link that is printed in your terminal window.

> Note: if you encounter issues, I'd suggest that you paste the error messages you get in terminal into ChatGPT and follow its suggestions. It this doesn't work, message in Discord!

## 6) Follow The Setup Guide

Once you have the app running, you can follow the setup guide inside the app to get started!
